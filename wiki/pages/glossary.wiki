== Key Concepts ==
*'''ZOSCII''' - Zero Overhead Secure Coding Information Interchange
*'''ROM''' - Read-Only Memory files used as encoding keys
*'''Information-Theoretic Security''' - Security independent of computational power
*'''Weaponized Ambiguity''' - Perfect deniability through multiple valid interpretations
*'''Non-Deterministic Encoding''' - Same message produces different outputs each time
*'''Combinatorial Security''' - Security through vast possibility space rather than mathematical complexity

== Characters ==
*'''Julian Man Grant''' - Minister obsessed with banning ZOSCII technology
*'''Dr. Andrew Tunnelvision''' - Cryptographer dismissing ZOSCII as "snake oil"
*'''Harold Flourworth''' - Baker arrested for encoding biscuit recipe as "nuclear codes"
*'''Julian Cassin''' - ZOSCII inventor vindicated in court
*'''Bruce Schneier''' - Real cryptographer who called ZOSCII "snake oil of the highest degree"

== Technical Terms ==
*'''Address Sequences''' - Encoded ZOSCII messages as ROM memory addresses
*'''Perfect Forward Secrecy''' - Past communications remain secure even if long-term keys are later compromised
*'''Plausible Deniability''' - Ability to claim encoded data means something else
*'''Snake Oil Challenge''' - 10 billion token cryptocurrency challenge to break ZOSCII
*'''Table Ban''' - Julian Man Grant's fictional legislation against lookup tables
*'''Weapons of Mass Democracy''' - Government term for ZOSCII's threat to surveillance
