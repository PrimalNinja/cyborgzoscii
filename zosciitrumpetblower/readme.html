            <h2>🎯 How It Works</h2>
            
            <div class="warning">
                <p><strong>⚠️ IMPORTANT: There is NO hosted encoding client for ZOSCII TrumpetBlower.</strong></p>
                <p>You MUST download the client from GitHub and run it locally to ensure your ROM is never uploaded to any server.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="steps">
                <strong>Step-by-Step:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Download the client from GitHub</strong><br>
                    Visit: <a href="https://github.com/PrimalNinja/cyborgzoscii" target="_blank">https://github.com/PrimalNinja/cyborgzoscii</a><br>
                    Download the 'trumpetblower.html' client to your computer</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Verify the client is NOT minified</strong><br>
                    Open the HTML file in a text editor. The code should be readable with proper spacing and comments.<br>
                    If it looks like compressed gibberish on one line, DO NOT USE IT.<br>
                    Readable code = trustworthy. Minified code = potential compromise.</li>

					<li><strong>Establish Anonymity (Use Tor) 🌐</strong><br>
					                    <strong>Your anonymity is your first line of defense.</strong><br>
					                    What Tor Does: Tor routes your connection through multiple relays, making it virtually impossible for the host or any observer to determine your true <strong>IP address</strong> or geographic location.<br>
					                    <br>
					                    <strong>Option A (Recommended): Tor Browser</strong><br>
					                    1. Go to the official Tor Project website: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" target="_blank">https://www.torproject.org/download/</a><br>
					                    2. Download, install, and launch the Tor Browser.<br>
					                    3. You <strong>must</strong> use this browser for all subsequent steps involving the server.<br>
					                    <br>
					                    <strong>Option B (Highest Security): Tails OS</strong><br>
					                    1. Follow the installation guide: <a href="https://tails.net/install/" target="_blank">https://tails.net/install/</a><br>
					                    2. Run the local 'trumpetblower.html' file <strong>within the Tails environment and Tor Browser</strong>.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Run the client locally</strong><br>
                    Open the HTML file in your browser from your local filesystem<br>
                    Do NOT use any hosted version - only trust what you've verified yourself</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Configure the Server</strong><br>
                    Enter the ZOSCII TrumpetBlower Server URL you wish to use, See <a href="#known-servers">available servers</a> below<br>
                    Enter a channel number (an integer), something not identifiable to you, it doesn't matter if it is used already or not, it's just easier to find unknown data by a reference in future<br>
                    Enter a number of desired retention weeks (an integer)</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Encode your documents</strong><br>
                    <strong>💡 Recommended:</strong> ZIP your files before encoding. This reduces our storage overhead and preserves file metadata like date/time stamps that can serve as evidence of when documents existed.<br><br>
                    Use any file as your ROM (photo, document, etc.)<br>
					There should be no red lines in the verification character usage<br>
                    The ROM becomes your encoding key - NEVER upload it anywhere<br>
                    The client will create an address file (just pointers, no actual data)</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Keep your ROM safe</strong><br>
                    Store your ROM securely - you'll need it to decode later<br>
                    Losing your ROM = losing your data forever<br>
                    Your ROM is your key to release the information when you're ready</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Submit to Server</strong><br>
                    Only the address file is uploaded with the channel and retention, the address file contains none of the original data - just pointers<br>
                    We (and everyone else) can't decode it without your ROM<br>
                    When you're ready to blow the trumpet, release your ROM publicly</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Redundancy</strong><br>
                    All address files are made available for download, replication and of course for when you wish to make a noise<br>

                <h3 style="color: #856404; margin-top: 0;">⚖️ Australian Legal Notice</h3>
                <p>This service operates under Australian law and is subject to the <strong>Assistance and Access Act 2018</strong>.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Under this legislation, we may be compelled to:</p>
                <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Assist with lawful access to communications</li>
                    <li>Implement technical capability measures</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>This is exactly why we recommend downloading and verifying the client yourself.</strong> If we were ever compelled to modify our code, you would be able to detect it by comparing against the GitHub source or noticing minification. By running your own verified local copy, you eliminate this risk entirely.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>For maximum security: Only use the local client version downloaded from the official GitHub repository.</strong></p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>We literally cannot know what you've uploaded.</strong> No encryption to break. No data to compel. Just addresses pointing to... something.
            </div>

            <p><strong>Legal protection:</strong> Many jurisdictions protect whistleblowers. ZOSCII TrumpetBlower adds technical protection beyond legal - even corrupt governments can't access what we don't have.</p>

            <div class="warning">
                <p><strong>⚠️ Critical: Use the official GitHub client.</strong><br>
                → Verify it's NOT minified<br>
                → Confirm it does NOT upload your ROM<br>

                <strong>📅 File Retention Policy</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Upon submission, you'll specify a rough timeframe for how long you'd like us to keep your address file as a minimum. We ask this because we'll try our best to honor it, but due to server costs we may need to remove files on occasion.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Since we have no way of knowing what's in each encoded file, the only thing we can ask is: <strong>How many weeks do you want us to keep the file for as a minimum?</strong></p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">We know the time you upload it and will consider the weeks beyond that. We'll try our best to accommodate your timeline.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;"><strong>💡 Tip:</strong> For maximum resilience, consider uploading your address file to multiple ZOSCII TrumpetBlower instances or mirrors. Since the file is just pointers, spreading it across multiple hosts ensures it stays available even if one site goes down.</p>
