Example Files:

• ZERO encryption, ZERO ciphering
• Uses JavaScript ZOSCII COIN Key Encoder / Verifier utility found here (no minification, fully transparent, download from github if you want to run it locally for greater security)
• YOU KNOW IT IS A 64 CHARACTER WALLET KEY ENCODED AS 128 BYTES WHICH LOWERS ZOSCII SECURITY
• ZOSCII Technology Security: ~10^156 combinations
• BUT wallet keys only have ~10^77 possible values (64 hex chars)
• Net Challenge Security: ~10^77 combinations
• This equals standard cryptocurrency private key security but with ZERO encryption
• General ROM Capacity: ~10^615 combinations
• *Without this content disclosure, security would have approached 10^615 and total plausible deniability
