## ztbcreate - Create Your Blockchain Foundation

### What it does:
Creates the Genesis ROM - the immutable "seed" that anchors your entire blockchain.

### Why you need it:
Every blockchain starts here. This 64KB file of high-entropy random data becomes the root of trust. Without it, nothing else works.

### When to use it:
Once, at the very beginning, before creating any blocks.

### What happens:
- Generates 64KB of random data
- Analyzes entropy to ensure all 256 byte values (0-255) are present
- Warns if any values are missing (would break encoding later)
- Saves the Genesis ROM file

> **Important:** Keep this file safe and backed up! If you lose it, you can never decode your blocks again. All verification depends on this file.

### Example:
```bash
ztbcreate genesis.rom
```

## ztbaddblock - Add Data to Your Chain

### What it does:
Adds a new block of data to an existing chain (trunk or branch).

### Why you need it:
This is how you store data on the blockchain - documents, transactions, records, anything.

### When to use it:
Every time you want to add new data to your chain.

### What happens:
- Takes your data (text string or file)
- Pads it to minimum size if needed
- Builds a Rolling ROM from previous blocks + Genesis
- Encodes your data using ZOSCII (makes it tamperproof)
- Creates a new block file: `chainid_0001_blockguid.ztb`

### Options:
- `-t "text"` - Add a text string
- `-f filename` - Add a file's contents

### Example:
```bash
# First block on a new trunk
ztbaddblock genesis.rom MyTrunk -t "Invoice #001"

# Second block
ztbaddblock genesis.rom MyTrunk -t "Invoice #002"

# Add a file
ztbaddblock genesis.rom MyTrunk -f contract.pdf
```

---

## ztbaddbranch - Create a Parallel Chain

### What it does:
Creates a new branch that splits off from the trunk at the current point.

### Why you need it:
Perfect for organizing data hierarchically. Think: trunk = company, branches = departments. Or trunk = financial year, branches = accounts.

### When to use it:
When you want to create a separate but linked chain of blocks.

### What happens:
- Checks that the trunk exists
- Checks that the branch name isn't already used
- Creates the first block of the new branch
- Links it to the current trunk tip
- Future blocks can be added to this branch using `ztbaddblock`

### Example:
```bash
# Create main company trunk
ztbaddblock genesis.rom CompanyLedger -t "2024 Books"

# Branch off for departments
ztbaddbranch genesis.rom CompanyLedger Sales -t "Sales Q1"
ztbaddbranch genesis.rom CompanyLedger Marketing -t "Marketing Q1"

# Now add blocks to branches
ztbaddblock genesis.rom Sales -t "Sale #001"
ztbaddblock genesis.rom Marketing -t "Campaign #001"
```

## ztbfetch - Read Your Data Back

### What it does:
Retrieves and decodes a specific block from any chain.

### Why you need it:
To actually read the data you stored! Blocks are ZOSCII-encoded, so you need this tool to decode them.

### When to use it:
Whenever you want to see what's in a block.

### What happens:
- Finds the requested block file
- Reconstructs the Rolling ROM (samples from previous blocks)
- Decodes the ZOSCII-encoded data
- Verifies the checksum (detects tampering)
- Shows you the decoded payload

### Example:
```bash
# Fetch block 3 from MyTrunk
ztbfetch genesis.rom MyTrunk 3

# Output shows:
# - Block metadata (ID, timestamp, etc.)
# - Checksum verification
# - Your decoded data
```

---

## ztbverify - Prove Integrity

### What it does:
Verifies that your blockchain is intact and untampered. Works backwards from the latest block to Genesis.

### Why you need it:
To prove your data hasn't been altered. If anyone modifies even one byte in block 5, verification will fail on block 6 (and all subsequent blocks).

### When to use it:
- Before presenting data as evidence
- After receiving blocks from someone else
- Periodically to ensure your archive is intact
- After restoring from backup

### What happens:
- Scans all blocks in the chain
- Rebuilds each block's Rolling ROM
- Decodes each block
- Verifies checksums
- Tests the tamperproof linking
- Reports PASS/FAIL for each block

### Options:
- No flag - Verify trunk and all branches
- `-t` - Verify trunk only
- `-b branchid` - Verify specific branch only
- `-bb` - Verify all branches only (skip trunk)

### Example:
```bash
# Verify everything
ztbverify genesis.rom MyTrunk

# Verify just the trunk
ztbverify genesis.rom MyTrunk -t

# Verify specific branch
ztbverify genesis.rom MyTrunk -b Sales
```

**Result:** If ANY block has been tampered with, verification fails and tells you exactly which block is corrupt.

## ztbcheckpoint - Archive Old Data

### What it does:
Creates an archival boundary that lets you move old blocks to slow/cheap storage while keeping the chain verifiable.

### Why you need it:
Over time, chains grow huge. Checkpoints let you archive historical data without breaking the chain.

### When to use it:
- End of financial year
- When chain gets too large
- Before migrating to new storage
- Creating self-contained archives

### What happens:
- Creates a special Type 2 (checkpoint) block
- This block becomes a new "mini-genesis"
- Blocks after this point can build Rolling ROMs from checkpoint â†’ Genesis (skipping archived blocks)
- You can move blocks BEFORE the checkpoint to slow storage
- Each archive gets its own copy of Genesis ROM for independent verification

### Example:
```bash
# At end of 2024
ztbcheckpoint MyTrunk genesis.rom last_block_of_2024_guid

# Now you can:
# 1. Move all 2024 blocks + Genesis ROM to archive storage
# 2. Keep checkpoint + 2025 blocks on fast storage
# 3. Both archives remain independently verifiable
```

## Real-World Workflow Example

**Scenario:** Accounting firm tracking invoices with separate accounts

```bash
# 1. Start fresh
ztbcreate genesis.rom

# 2. Create main trunk for 2025
ztbaddblock genesis.rom FY2025 -t "Financial Year 2025"

# 3. Create branches for different accounts
ztbaddbranch genesis.rom FY2025 ClientA -t "Client A Account"
ztbaddbranch genesis.rom FY2025 ClientB -t "Client B Account"

# 4. Add invoices to Client A
ztbaddblock genesis.rom ClientA -t "Invoice #1001"
ztbaddblock genesis.rom ClientA -f invoice_1002.pdf

# 5. Add invoices to Client B
ztbaddblock genesis.rom ClientB -t "Invoice #2001"

# 6. Retrieve a specific invoice
ztbfetch genesis.rom ClientA 2

# 7. Verify everything is intact
ztbverify genesis.rom FY2025

# 8. At year-end, create checkpoint
ztbcheckpoint FY2025 genesis.rom last_block_guid

# 9. Archive 2025 data to slow storage, start FY2026
```

## Key Concepts for Users

### Tamperproof
If you change ANY byte in block N, all blocks N+1 onwards fail verification. The ZOSCII pointer encoding makes forgery combinatorially impossible (10^152900 combinations).

### No Decryption Needed
This isn't encryption - it's addressing. The data is encoded as pointers into the Rolling ROM. Without the exact Rolling ROM, the pointers are meaningless.

### Independent Archives
Checkpoints + Genesis copies let you create self-contained archives that verify independently. Perfect for legal compliance, backups, and long-term storage.

### Branch Organization
Use branches like folders. Trunk = main timeline, branches = parallel sub-timelines. All verified together.
