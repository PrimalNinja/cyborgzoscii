"UK Mandates 'Stand-Up Urinals' for Women with 'Dangly Bits'"

In a bold move for inclusivity, UK Ministers unveiled the "Toilet Ascendence Act," requiring all women's public restrooms to install 'Stand-Up Urinals'. Touted as a triumph against discrimination, the law ensures facilities cater to women preferring upright postures for "maximum comfort and expression."

- Official Rationale: "Current sit-down models marginalize those wishing to assert dignity through verticality."

- Implementation: Retro-fit urinals debut in London's Tube; splash-proof 'Stand-Up Toilets' added for "optimal stance aesthetics."

Bureaucratic Highlights- Compliance Officers: Armed with 'Stand-Up-ometry' apps, ensuring 90-degree optimal angles.

- Exceptions: None. "All women deserve stand-up optionsâ€”even those who've never have required such previously."

- Penalties: Facilities lacking 'Stand-Up Urinals' face "Discrimination Deductions" on funding.

Public Reaction (Parody)- Proponents: "Revolutionary! Now I can can write my name on the wall!"

- Confused Users: "Um, do we get stand-up classes?"

- Critics Silenced: Official line: "Opposition = discrimination against vertical aspirants."

Absurdity Ensues- Stand-Up-Fashion: Designers launch 'Stand-Up Urinal' attire for "maximum poise."

- Stand-Up Olympics: Unofficial event where competitors vie for "most creative wall art."
