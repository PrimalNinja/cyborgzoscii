# British Safety Commissioner Declares War on International Satire, Demands Global Extradition for "Digital Mockery"

**Threatens to arrest foreign satirists upon UK arrival for "crimes against regulatory dignity"**

LONDON - eSafety Commissioner Patricia Bubble-Wrap announced sweeping international enforcement powers, demanding extradition of foreign satirists who mock Britain's Online Safety Act, declaring satirical content "a clear threat to regulatory authority."

"These so-called 'comedians' in Australia and America are undermining our life-saving legislation," declared Bubble-Wrap while brandishing a list of banned international websites. "Writing jokes about our perfectly reasonable internet restrictions constitutes digital terrorism against British children."

The "Global Satirical Suppression Initiative" now classifies international mockery as "cross-border regulatory interference," with Bubble-Wrap demanding Interpol arrest warrants for writers who dare suggest the Safety Act might be authoritarian overreach.

"We've identified 47,000 foreign satirists spreading dangerous 'humor' about our policies," explained Chief Digital Enforcement Officer Margaret Humorless. "Anyone making jokes about our surveillance—I mean safety—measures will face immediate arrest upon entering British airspace."

International comedians have responded by creating "Satire Sanctuaries" in countries with functioning democracies, while British comedy clubs sit empty, their performers having fled to nations where laughter remains legal.

The European Court of Human Rights issued an emergency ruling declaring Bubble-Wrap's demands "clinically insane," prompting Britain to threaten sanctions against countries harboring "dangerous joke-writers."

Travel advisories now warn satirists that visiting Britain carries a "high risk of imprisonment for insufficient reverence toward regulatory overreach."
