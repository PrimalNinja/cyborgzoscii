# UK Thought Police Launch "Operation Serenity Sweep" with Mass Arrests at Mosque and Church Flanking Abortion Clinic

**Officers target worshippers at adjacent religious sites for "proximate prayer," claim clinic's neutrality is at stake**

LONDONBRIDGE - The Buffer Zone Benevolence Brigade has unleashed its boldest move yet, "Operation Serenity Sweep," targeting worshippers at the Al-Noor Mosque and St. Mary’s Catholic Church, which sit directly on either side of the Londonbridge Women’s Health Clinic. The mass arrests, netting over 50 congregants, were justified as a necessary defense against "excessive spiritual proximity" to the abortion facility wedged tightly between the two sacred spaces.

"The clinic is literally squeezed between a mosque and a church—prayers are practically ricocheting off the walls," fumed Chief Inspector Empathy-Deficit McStrictface, waving a tape measure showing the clinic’s entrance is a mere 10 meters from each religious site. "We can’t have people sending well-wishes for patients’ safety from such close range. It’s a clear threat to the clinic’s vibe-neutral environment."

The sweep targeted diverse acts of "covert compassion." At the mosque, women reciting dua for the well-being of clinic patients were hauled away mid-prayer, with one officer shouting, "No spiritual osmosis on my watch!" At St. Mary’s, parishioners clutching rosaries and whispering hopes for safe medical procedures were cuffed, their beads logged as "potential tools of silent intimidation." Even a church janitor muttering a blessing while mopping was detained for "unlicensed serenity."

"It’s not about the prayers themselves," clarified Deputy Commissioner Double-Standard O’Hypocrite, "but their dangerous proximity. A heartfelt dua or Hail Mary from next door could subliminally influence someone 10 meters away. Meanwhile, the lads screaming about lizard people across the street? Totally fine—louder, but less spiritually charged."

One detainee, Fatima Ali, was baffled: "I was praying for my niece to come through her appointment safely. I didn’t even know the clinic was next door until the sirens started!" A Catholic retiree echoed her confusion: "I was in church, minding my own business, praying for everyone’s health. Now my rosary’s in an evidence bag."

The operation ignored a nearby punk band’s impromptu "Anarchy Against Antibiotics" concert, which blocked traffic but was deemed "non-spiritual and thus non-threatening." The Home Office’s short-lived "Proximity Prayer Analysis Unit" imploded after failing to calculate the "emotional radius" of a sincere thought. The space now houses the "Buffer Zone Aura Patrol," developing radar to detect "excessive empathy waves."

Locals, fearing accidental arrests, have begun holding services in alleyways exactly 151 meters from the clinic, using laser rangefinders to stay compliant.
