# UK Hospitals Overwhelmed as Face-Scan Crisis Triggers Both Mirror-Phobia and Existential Breakdowns in Children

**Medical system collapses as AI denies children's humanity while forcing traumatic self-recognition**

LONDON - British hospitals are experiencing unprecedented overcrowding as thousands of children suffer severe psychological trauma from mandatory face-scan age verification, experiencing both mirror-phobia episodes and existential crises after systems deny their basic humanity.

"We're seeing a perfect storm of eisoptrophobic reactions combined with identity breakdowns," explained Dr. Sarah Overwhelmed from Great Ormond Street Hospital's emergency overflow tent. "Children terrified of seeing their own faces are simultaneously being told by AI that they're 847 years old or don't exist at all."

The dual crisis has pushed hospital capacity to levels that dwarf any pandemic, with traumatized children who can no longer look at reflective surfaces while also questioning their fundamental existence. Eight-year-old Tommy Confused suffered a complete breakdown after a system claimed his toy dinosaur was younger than him while insisting Tommy himself was "not a real person."

"Some children now refuse mirrors believing they might be invisible ancient spirits, while others have panic attacks from any self-recognition process," admitted Chief Medical Officer Professor Obvious McStethoscope.

The government is desperately converting concrete farms into makeshift psychiatric facilities, though treatment remains complicated by face-scanning systems at hospital entrances that continue traumatizing patients while demanding verification from people they claim don't exist.

"We're treating children simultaneously gaslit by algorithms and terrorized by their own reflections," concluded Health Secretary Margaret Ironic.
