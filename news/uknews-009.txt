# UK Government Abandons Names Entirely, Assigns All Citizens Safety-Compliant Numbers

**"Operation Numerical Identity" eliminates linguistic trauma by replacing names with sequential digits**

LONDON - Following months of mandatory name changes that left 97% of British names classified as "phonetically dangerous," the government announced all citizens will be assigned identification numbers to eliminate naming-related trauma entirely.

"We realized even approved names like 'Safe-Calm Beige-Approved' could be mispronounced in harmful ways," explained newly designated Citizen #000001, formerly Commissioner Patricia Bubble-Wrap. "Numbers cannot trigger phobias, unless children suffer from arithmophobia, which we're currently investigating."

The "Numerical Identity Protection Initiative" assigns citizens sequential numbers based on alphabetical order of their former dangerous names. Families are now designated by household unit numbers, with children receiving decimal extensions: Household-4729.1, Household-4729.2, etc.

"My son was traumatized when someone called me 'Dad,'" explained Citizen #045678, formerly David Potentially-Harmful. "That word contains 'ad' which could be commercial exploitation. Now he just calls me by my safety number."

Schools have been renamed "Educational Unit-001," "Educational Unit-002," eliminating potentially triggering words like "primary" (suggests hierarchy) or "comprehensive" (implies inadequacy elsewhere). Teachers now answers to "Instructor-[number]" to avoid the authoritarian implications of educational titles.

The only remaining challenge: some children have developed "number anxiety" after realizing their assigned digits are mathematically larger than their siblings', suggesting they're somehow "worse" people.

"We're considering switching to colors," admitted Safety Official #000842, "though beige-phobia remains a concern."
