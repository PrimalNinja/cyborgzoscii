# UK Immigration Office Celebrates "Contradictory Values Integration Program"

**Ministry announces simultaneous embrace of opposing principles while officials struggle to explain logic**

NEWBRIDGE - The Department of Social Harmony announced its groundbreaking "Selective Values Importation Initiative," welcoming immigrants based on whether their cultural backgrounds directly contradict the nation's stated domestic policies.

"We're proud to offer premium housing to newcomers from regions where our own citizens would face imprisonment for identical behaviors," declared Immigration Minister Reginald Paradox-Wellington. "It's about celebrating diversity by applying completely different standards to different groups."

The program specifically targets immigrants from nations that ban the very freedoms Newbridge claims to champion, while simultaneously restricting those same freedoms for existing residents. "Why should consistency limit our humanitarian outreach?" asked Deputy Minister Cognitive Dissonance-Smith.

When journalists noted the apparent contradiction with the recently passed "Digital Safety for All Citizens Act," which monitors every online interaction for potential harm, Minister Paradox-Wellington explained: "That's entirely different. We need total surveillance to protect people online, but offline safety isn't really our department."

"Besides," he added while adjusting his 'Digital Privacy Champion' lapel pin, "mass surveillance for physical safety would be too expensive. We spent the entire safety budget on monitoring emoji usage and flagging dangerous punctuation patterns."

The ministry's "Logical Consistency Department" was reportedly dissolved last Tuesday after staff members suffered collective nervous breakdowns trying to reconcile official policies. Their former office now houses the "Beneficial Contradictions Research Center."

Citizens have begun communicating through interpretive dance, as it remains the only form of expression not yet subject to conflicting regulations.
