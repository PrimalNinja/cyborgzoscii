# UK Government's Number System Collapses as Digits Also Deemed "Phonetically Dangerous"

**Citizens reduced to beige color swatches after realizing all numbers sound like harmful words**

LONDON - The government's "Numerical Identity Protection Initiative" suffered immediate collapse after safety auditors discovered that virtually all numbers contain "traumatic phonetic implications" when spoken aloud or combined in sequences.

"We can't use six because some accents make it sound like 'sex,' and four sounds like 'dead' in Chinese," explained Safety Official #000842, now desperately clutching a beige color swatch. "Then we realized seventeen sounds like 'seven-teen' which implies teenage trauma, and sixty-nine... well, that's obviously banned."

The crisis deepened when algorithms identified dangerous phonetic combinations in larger numbers. "One-thousand-seven-hundred" sounds like "won-thousand-heaven-hundred," implying gambling, death, and mathematics anxiety simultaneously. "Eighty-six" was banned for sounding like "ate-tea-six," promoting unhealthy eating habits while referencing the forbidden digit.

"Twenty-two" resembles "twin-tea-two," suggesting multiple personality disorders and caffeine addiction. Even "three-hundred-and-one" was flagged because "three-hun-dread-and-won" contains mortality references and competitive implications.

Citizens have been temporarily assigned beige color swatches for identification, though authorities are investigating whether "beige" itself might sound like "beg" to some accents, implying financial distress.

"We're running out of safe ways to identify humans," admitted the official formerly known as Patricia Bubble-Wrap, now carrying Color-Swatch-#847592, "though we're concerned that swatch numbers might also be problematic.".  Even represening numbers as morse code on badges looks like ants and worms to some children.

The population now communicates entirely through synchronized blinking patterns.
