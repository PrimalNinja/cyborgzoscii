# Retro Computing Ban Proposed After Government Surveillance Systems Defeated by Commodore 64

**Minister declares 8-bit computers "weaponized nostalgia," demands immediate internet disconnection**

CANBERRA - Following the discovery that vintage computers can bypass modern surveillance systems, Minister Julian Man Grant announced emergency legislation to ban all pre-2020 computers from internet access, claiming the government "lacks the technological capability to monitor Pac-Man era communications."

The crisis began when intelligence agencies admitted their $50 billion cyber-surveillance network cannot analyze traffic from Commodore 64s, Apple IIs, or any system running on less than 16GB of RAM.

"Our AI-powered threat detection was trained on Windows 11 and TikTok," explained a visibly sweating Grant while lying prone on the parliament floor. "It sees optimized address table communications and just... gives up. Blue screens. Starts crying."

The situation worsened after Grant's earlier "Anti-Tabular Surfaces Act" inadvertently exempted most 8-bit computers, which flew under the radar by using direct ROM addressing instead of traditional lookup tables. "We banned tables, but these ancient machines don't use tables - they use raw memory addresses!" wailed a Department of Digital Surveillance official.

Grant's proposed "Computational Obsolescence Prevention Act" would require all internet-connected devices to have minimum surveillance-compatibility requirements, including built-in government backdoors, mandatory telemetry, and at least 32 processing cores "so our spying algorithms have somewhere to hide."

The retro computing community responded by organizing a "1980s Internet Party," flooding government servers with optimized address table traffic from machines older than most cabinet ministers. Early reports suggest the surveillance network has begun playing Pong and asking for more quarters.

Grant concluded the press conference by demanding emergency powers to "make the internet compatible with our spying again, like the good old days of 2019."

NOTE: This is a satirical news piece about the absurd consequences of a panic-driven ban on tables. The escalating absurdity from personal inconvenience to complete societal collapse is classic satirical structure.
