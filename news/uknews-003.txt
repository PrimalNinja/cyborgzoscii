# UK Police Launch "Operation Shoulder Surf" to Arrest Parents After Children Glimpse Prohibited Content

**"Accidental bird viewing" now carries 5-year sentence as authorities deploy microscopic surveillance**

LONDON - Following the Online Safety Act's expansion, UK police announced the formation of specialized "Digital Glimpse Units" tasked with arresting parents whose children accidentally view prohibited content, including glancing at screens showing Teletubbies or nature documentaries.

"We've identified seventeen cases of illegal shoulder-surfing this week," announced Inspector Margaret Overreach from Scotland Yard's new Peripheral Vision Crime Division. "One child accidentally saw a butterfly on their mother's gardening website. The trauma could last decades."

The crackdown has led to mass arrests after authorities installed "retina-tracking cameras" in all homes to monitor children's involuntary eye movements. Parents now face prosecution for "reckless content exposure" if their child glimpses anything with insects, animals, or bright colors.

"We caught a father reading BBC Weather while his son was in the same room," explained Constable Derek Ridiculous. "Storm warnings are clearly age-restricted content. The psychological damage from seeing cloud formations could destroy that child's future."

Families have responded by wearing blindfolds in their own homes, while emergency "content-safe zones" feature only beige walls and monotone humming. The prison system has collapsed under the weight of incarcerated parents, with judges now wearing vision-restricting helmets to avoid accidentally viewing prohibited evidence.

"We're building a safer Britain, one arrested parent at a time," declared the Inspector before being arrested for saying the word "building," which triggers construction-phobia.
