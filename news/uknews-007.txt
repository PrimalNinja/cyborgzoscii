# Online Dictionaries Forced to Delete 80% of Content as Every Word Deemed "Potentially Harmful" Under Safety Act

**Educational websites collapse as algorithms discover language itself contains traumatic concepts**

LONDON - Major online dictionaries announced they're removing up to 80% of their content after the Online Safety Act's automated systems identified virtually every word as "potentially harmful to children," with companies citing "responsible ethics" in avoiding unreliable face-scan trauma.

"We discovered our dictionary is essentially a massive map of dangerous concepts," explained Oxford Online spokesperson Margaret Vocabulary-Destroyer. "The word 'bank' could mean riverbank or financial institution - that ambiguity might confuse children. 'Bat' could be a sports equipment or flying mammal - clearly traumatic uncertainty."

The crisis escalated when algorithms flagged phonetic similarities, banning words that sound like subsets of other potentially harmful terms. Educational technology companies report being unable to teach basic computing concepts to children.

"It's impossible to teach Linux when fundamental terms like 'root,' 'kill,' and 'daemon' are all banned," wailed IT education director Professor Digital Despair. "We can't explain file systems without using 'directory,' which sounds like 'die-rectory' - clearly traumatic."

Collins Dictionary now contains only seventeen approved words, all describing beige geometric shapes, while Cambridge Dictionary was reduced to displaying the single word "SAFE" after every other entry triggered multiple safety violations.

Children attempting to complete homework now receive error messages stating "educational content unavailable due to linguistic hazards," while teachers resort to pointing at objects and grunting to avoid using potentially problematic vocabulary listerally bringing classrooms back to the cavemen era.

"We're protecting children from the horror of comprehensive language," concluded Education Secretary Patricia Wordless.
