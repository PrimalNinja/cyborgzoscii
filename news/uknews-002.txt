# UK Online Safety Act 2025: 99.7% of Internet Now Requires Age Verification After Government Discovers Children Have Phobias About Everything

**Teletubbies declared "purple menace" as Ofcom realizes literally everything terrifies someone**

LONDON - In a stunning regulatory expansion under the Online Safety Act 2025, Ofcom announced that virtually the entire internet now requires age verification after discovering children can develop phobias about absolutely anything that exists.

"We started with harmful content, but then realized birds terrify some kids," explained Ofcom Commissioner Patricia Bubble-Wrap while nervously eyeing a potted plant. "Then we found arachnophobia, entomophobia, trypophobia - there's literally a phobia for everything!"

The emergency Online Safety Amendment now mandates age verification for websites featuring: Teletubbies (bright colors), nature documentaries (insects/animals), cooking shows (sharp knives), weather reports (storms), educational content (buttons/repetitive patterns), gardening sites (dirt), and mathematics tutorials (numbers anxiety).

"Even our own government website now requires age verification because some children have politico-phobia," admitted Digital Safety Officer Margaret Terrified, speaking from her newly required sensory deprivation chamber.

The only remaining child-safe content is a single beige webpage displaying "APPROVED" in Comic Sans font, though authorities are reviewing reports of typography-based trauma disorders.

Parents nationwide teach children to read using blank paper, while the economy collapses as every business website requires adult verification to display their logo.

"We're protecting children from the horror of existing," concluded the Commissioner before fainting.
