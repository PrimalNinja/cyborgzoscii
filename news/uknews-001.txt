# British eSafety Act 2025: Clown Websites Banned After "Psychological Trauma" Claims

**Minister declares red noses "gateway to digital terror," mandates beige-only entertainment**

LONDON - Following widespread panic over children allegedly suffering "coulrophobic episodes" from online clown content, the British eSafety Commission announced emergency legislation banning all circus-themed websites effective immediately.

"We've received reports of children having nightmares after seeing birthday party entertainers online," declared eSafety Commissioner Patricia Bubble-Wrap. "Clearly, red noses and oversized shoes constitute psychological warfare against our youth."

The sweeping Digital Clown Prevention Act requires all entertainment websites to undergo "humor safety assessments" before publication. Approved content must feature only beige backgrounds, monotone voices, and "emotionally neutral facial expressions."

"We're protecting children from the devastating trauma of laughter," explained Chief Digital Wellness Officer Margaret Joyless while standing beside a PowerPoint presentation featuring exclusively gray rectangles.

The circus industry has responded by pivoting to "therapeutic mime performances," though authorities warn silent entertainment could cause "dangerous introspection disorders."

The legislation extends to balloon animals, face painting tutorials, and any content featuring "aggressively cheerful color schemes." Violators face fines equivalent to the psychological damage caused by "excessive whimsy."

Opposition leaders criticized the move while lying prone on parliament's floor, having already banned furniture for "structural intimidation concerns."
