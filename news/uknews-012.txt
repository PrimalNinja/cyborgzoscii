# UK Thought Police Unveil "Silent Prayer Suppression Scheme"

**Force promises to protect clinic access by criminalizing well-wishes, while overlooking actual disruptions**

LONDONBRIDGE - The Home Office's newly formed "Buffer Zone Benevolence Brigade" has rolled out its innovative "No Good Vibes Allowed" policy, targeting individuals caught in the act of quiet contemplation near abortion facilities—especially mothers hoping their daughters emerge unscathed and anxious patients muttering pleas to cope with their hospital phobias.

"We're committed to fostering a harassment-free environment by handcuffing anyone who dares to send positive thoughts skyward," proclaimed Chief Inspector Empathy-Deficit McStrictface. "Nothing says 'women's rights' like fining a terrified mum £800 for whispering hopes that her child doesn't suffer complications during the procedure."

The initiative zeroes in on "menacing mental activities," such as mothers kneeling silently to pray for their daughters' safe exit from the clinic, or incoming patients pausing to beseech divine intervention because, as one arrestee put it, "Hospitals scare me more than ghosts—needles, beeps, and that sterile smell!" Officials insist these acts constitute "intimidation," even as boisterous climate activists glue themselves to nearby roads without so much as a warning.

When pressed on why vocal anti-vax rallies or rowdy football chants are permitted in the same vicinities, Deputy Commissioner Double-Standard O'Hypocrite replied: "That's apples and oranges. Shouting about conspiracies builds community spirit, but a quiet 'please let her be okay' is basically psychological warfare. Plus, we've got limited handcuffs—priorities, you know?"

The brigade's "Cognitive Clarity Unit" was briefly consulted but disbanded after officers experienced existential crises over distinguishing prayer from daydreaming about lunch. The space now serves as a "Safe Space for Selective Outrage."

Local residents have taken to wearing noise-cancelling headphones and blindfolds when passing clinics, lest accidental thoughts lead to unintended arrests.
