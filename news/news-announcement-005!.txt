# Julian Man Grant Flees International Security Summit After ZOSCII Declared "Weapon of Mass Democracy"

**Minister caught hiding in hotel bathroom as world dictators demand immediate ban on "freedom-enabling" technology

GENEVA - Minister Julian Man Grant was forcibly extracted from a five-star hotel bathroom stall after spending 14 hours hiding from an increasingly hostile International Security Summit, where world leaders unanimously declared CyborgZOSCII a "clear and present danger to authoritarian stability."

The crisis began when Grant proudly presented Australia's "innovative response" to the ZOSCII threat, expecting praise from fellow security ministers. Instead, he was met with stunned silence, followed by what witnesses described as "the most terrifying synchronized dictator tantrum in diplomatic history."

"You idiots have unleashed digital anarchy!" screamed Supreme Leader Kim Jong-Paranoid, throwing his luxury hotel slippers at Grant's PowerPoint presentation. "How are we supposed to monitor dissidents when their shopping lists could secretly be pro-democracy manifestos? Or actual shopping lists? We can't tell the difference!"

## Dictators United in Panic

The summit quickly devolved into chaos as authoritarian leaders realized ZOSCII's implications for their surveillance states. Chinese President Xi Surveillance-Forever began hyperventilating after discovering that intercepted address lists from Hong Kong protesters could decode as either "FREEDOM NOW" or "NOODLE RECIPES" with equal mathematical validity.

"Our $50 billion social credit system is useless!" wailed Minister of Internal Oppression Vladimir Spy-On-Everyone. "We've been arresting people for seditious noodle recipes! Half our political prisoners might just be really enthusiastic cooks!"

The revelation that ZOSCII makes prosecution based on digital evidence mathematically impossible sent shock waves through the Global Dictatorship Alliance. Emergency sessions were called as leaders realized their standard intimidation tactics - monitoring communications, manufacturing evidence, and retroactive prosecution - were suddenly obsolete.

## Grant's Strategic Bathroom Retreat

As the international implications became clear, Grant reportedly excused himself for a "brief comfort break" and was discovered six hours later, fully clothed in a locked bathroom stall, frantically texting on what appeared to be a Commodore 64 jury-rigged to his mobile phone.

"He kept muttering about 'plausible deniability' and 'millions of interpretations,'" reported hotel security chief Gustav Concerned. "When we tried to extract him, he started shouting about digital liberation and something called 'weaponized ambiguity.' Very concerning behavior for a government minister."

Hotel staff confirmed that Grant had barricaded himself using toilet paper rolls and was communicating with the outside world exclusively through ZOSCII-encoded messages that simultaneously appeared to be resignation letters, grocery lists, and declarations of war depending on which ROM was used to decode them.

## The Dictator's Dilemma

The summit's final resolution declared ZOSCII an "existential threat to organized oppression" and demanded immediate international action. However, leaders quickly discovered they couldn't ban the technology without admitting their surveillance systems were completely ineffective - a revelation that would undermine their authority entirely.

"We're trapped in a paradox," explained Dr. Totalitarian McControl, the summit's chief advisor on population suppression. "If we ban ZOSCII, we admit our monitoring is useless. If we don't ban it, our monitoring becomes useless. Either way, people realize they can communicate freely without us knowing what they're saying."

The situation worsened when journalist investigations revealed that several dictatorships had been manufacturing evidence for years using similar "interpretation flexibility" techniques, accidentally proving that digital evidence had always been unreliable - exactly what ZOSCII demonstrates mathematically.

## Democracy Breaks Out Worldwide

Reports are flooding in of spontaneous democratic movements using ZOSCII to coordinate completely undetected. Authoritarian governments worldwide are discovering their intelligence agencies have been chasing shadows, arresting cookie enthusiasts as revolutionaries, and treating love poetry as terrorist communications.

"It's beautiful chaos," reported underground democracy activist Maria Freedom-Fighter via ZOSCII transmission that also appeared to be knitting instructions. "They can't tell if we're planning protests or planning dinner parties. Their paranoia is paralyzing them while we organize right under their noses."

The technology's impact has been particularly devastating for regimes that rely on digital surveillance. North Korea's internet monitoring division reportedly disbanded after realizing they'd been tracking millions of innocent messages they couldn't prove were innocent, while also missing millions of resistance communications they couldn't prove were resistance communications.

## Grant's Diplomatic Disaster

When finally extracted from his bathroom fortress, Grant was immediately deported by Swiss authorities who declared him "a threat to international dictatorial stability." His parting statement, delivered via interpretive dance (tables still being illegal), suggested he finally understood that he'd accidentally championed the greatest threat to authoritarianism since the printing press.

The summit concluded with a joint declaration demanding ZOSCII's inventor be arrested for "crimes against surveillance," though legal experts noted this would be impossible to prosecute since any evidence could have millions of innocent interpretations.

World dictators have reportedly begun considering retirement, with many exploring new careers in fields that don't require knowing what people are actually thinking. Grant remains in hiding, presumably still trying to figure out whether his own communications constitute resignation letters, vacation requests, or accidental confessions of democratic sympathy.
Meanwhile, freedom continues breaking out worldwide, one perfectly ambiguous message at a time.
